Step 1 â€“ Starting ELK Docker Container

1) There is a docker image already with name sebp/elk 
https://hub.docker.com/r/sebp/elk/
2) For this docker container to run , we need to set vm.max_map_count to at least
262144.
so, do the following : docker-machine ssh
you will be connected to the docker vm machine.
Execute sudo sysctl vm.max_map_count=262144
3) pull the docker image using -> docker pull sebp/elk
4) Run the elk container using
docker run -p 5601:5601 -p 9200:9200 -p 5044:5044 -p 5000:5000 -it --name elk sebp/elk
This command publishes the following ports, which are needed for proper operation of
the ELK stack:
5601 (Kibana web interface).
9200 (Elasticsearch JSON interface).
5044 (Logstash Beats interface, receives logs from Beats such as Filebeat )
We will be using 5000 port for sending logs to logstash from our application later
5) You can now access kibana at http://192.168.99.100:5601
Following are optional . If you have more time, you can follow. Otherwise go to STEP2.
6) Creating dummy log entries using logstash
First get the elk container id by executing the following command :
docker ps
docker exec -it <container-id> bash
At the command prompt , execute the following
cd /opt/logstash/bin
./ logstash -e 'input { stdin { } } output { elasticsearch { hosts => ["localhost"] } }'
Wait for Logstash to start (as indicated by the message Logstash startup completed),
then type some dummy text followed by Enter to create a log entry
Create 10 dummy entries
7) You Can search index elasticsearch using below URL:
http://198.168.99.100:9200/_search?pretty
8) You can now visit kibana web interface at http://192.168.99.100:5601
